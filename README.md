# Tools and Framework used for this project :

1. Vite + React.js: Vite.js was chosen for creating the app due to its significantly faster development server, superior hot-reloading experience, and built-in support for modern JavaScript features like ES modules and TypeScript. This combination results in a more efficient and enjoyable React development process.
2. React.js: The project extensively utilizes the React.js framework.
CSS: Instead of relying on the Mui library for layout or grid systems, most styles and layouts are implemented using common CSS. The BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology is employed for styling inheritance.
3. Redux for State Management: Redux is used for API fetching, searching, and overall state management, despite the possibility of managing state through prop-passing.
4. Material-UI Library: The Material-UI library is incorporated for components such as text fields and autocomplete.
